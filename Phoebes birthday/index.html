    <h2>Birthday message</h2>
    <p>
      To Phoebe, I'm glad you've finally turned 18. You have come so far as a person since the time I've met you, and more than that, I am glad to have met you. You are incredibly loyal, sticking through hard times, and incredibly good at working through issues. I hope clubbing and drinking are excellent, and I cannot wait to go with you. Keep doing what you're doing; everyone loves you. Also sorry im so bad at writing genuine heartfelt messages I tend to go on massive tangents you know me so id rather keep it short.
        Love from logan
    </p>

        <small>22nd of april 2023</small>
        <p>I think this was when i first met Renee and the first time i got a proper talk with your mum. It was when I started to realise how well your family have bonded which is something im envious of today and is a great quality of yours.</p>

        <small>20th of May 2023</small>
        <p>This wasnt exactly the first time i met your friends but it was the best time because i knew them all well we gave me a flower crown it was super warm AND WE HAD SHIRAZ best meal. We did that long walk i think this was when i met serena also. I think me meeting your friends taught me a lot about you as a person your likes dislikes and what you used to be like before me.</p>

        <small>10th of June 2023</small>
        <p>This was youre first time meeting the rest of my friends at least the new lot. Im glad you did as i think you enjoyed it. However, the most important thing here was how impressive it was seeing you randomly interact with new people you were quite good at it and everyone liked you and wanted to see you more which was something i was quite proud of.</p>

        <small>24th of September 2023</small>
        <p>This was the weirdest time for me because. Id never manage to work a relationship out this long nevermind without issues completley. I think it was here that i started to notice your skill for organizing things and researching. Ive always been bewildered at the subconsious thought you put into so many decisions and the date night to the botanist cemented that.</p>

        <h2>RIGHT NOW</h2>
        <small>29th of June 2022</small>
        <p>There is a large gap between the last one and this one but I think its just because thats life you've managed to fully integrate your way into it and its no longer weird to see you at all I do hope you'll stay a bit longer or for as long as you can. I think turning 18 is another shift in the relationship we are both going to have to grow into adults together and I think you out of everyone in the world is who id like to help me become an adult.</p>
